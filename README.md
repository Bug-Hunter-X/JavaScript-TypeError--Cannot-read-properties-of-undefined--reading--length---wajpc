# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error and its solution. The `bug.js` file contains code that throws a `TypeError` when an undefined value is passed to a function expecting an array or object with a 'length' property. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that handles undefined inputs gracefully.

## Description
The issue arises from attempting to access the `length` property of an undefined value. This happens because the function doesn't explicitly check for `undefined` as an input, leading to the error when an undefined value is passed. The solution is to add a check to handle the case of undefined values, either by returning a default value or throwing a more informative error.
